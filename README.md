# Tweet Video Maker

This module takes in the names of various Twitter users, as well as a number of cycles the user would like to make a video for. It can be called multiple times for different users for a different number of cycles.

## How to use the maker

Be sure to install the 'arial.ttf' font and have it in the directory with all of these scripts. Without it, the Wordcloud will not be able to run, as it uses the font to write dates on each image.

For easy use download the EasyAccess folder, which is pre-arranged to have all components to the module, necessary fonts, requirements, and the test code.
